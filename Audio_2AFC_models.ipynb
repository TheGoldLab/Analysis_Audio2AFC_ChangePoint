    "# Models for the 2AFC auditory triangles task\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal for this notebook is to create working models for the auditory 2AFC task. The goal of the project is to have people behave with different levels of mental model complexity. We will put together a more formal definition in another document, but briefly complexity is being characterized as the amount of past information being encoded to predict the future (cf., Bialek et al., 2001, Neural Computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal is to come up with task conditions that manipulate a person's model complexity while being exposed to very similar stimuli (i.e., use the same stimuli in more/less complex ways).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three conditions we would like to consider (at least, as a start):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passive condition:** This is the condition that requires the simplest model as no information needs to be encoded. The person would not have to make any responses, except for maybe catch trials to make sure they are paying attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stimulus Identification:** This condition requires a model, but not one that takes too much information. All it does is it identifies, on each trial, the identity of the previous stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source prediction**: The most complex model would be one in which the person tries to predict the stimulus/source on the next trial. This could be in a condition in which there is or there isn;t a hazard rate (so far these measures have been used in situations where a hazard rate needs to be inferred).\n",
    "\n",
    "The blocks below are meant to test different models that do different levels of inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source inference model:** Model that strictly attempts to infer the source generating the stimuli\n",
    "- **Source inference with fixed hazard:** Model that infers the source while considering a single, fixed hazard rate\n",
    "- **Source and hazard inference - fixed hazard:** Model that infers the the source and the hazard rate, assuming that sources can change but not the hazard rate. DOes this inference with a prior over the hazard space.\n",
    "- **Source and hazard inference - variable hazard:**: Model that infers the source and the hazard rate, but assumes that the hazard rate itself can also change. Also has a prior over the hazard space."
