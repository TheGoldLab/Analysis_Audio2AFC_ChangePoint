# Basic behavioral questions
- How many rows are there in the matrix?
- What are the meaning of each column in the table?
- How many valid trials are there in the matrix?
- Does the matrix say whether it is a report or a prediction block?
- Does the matrix contain some identifier for the subject (i.e. HUP number)?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
```

```{r}
# load data from one session
data <- fread('/home/adrian/Audio2AFC_CP/ECoG_patients/raw/2019_08_15_14_52/2019_08_15_14_52_FIRA.csv')
```

## How many rows in the matrix
```{r}
data[,.(numRows=.N)]
```

## Meaning of each column in the table
```{r}
str(data)
head(data)

```

```{r}
columnName <- names(data)
print(columnName)
```

```{r}
description <- c(
  "1 = Tutorial; 2 = Task",
  "index of trial in the order it was presented to patient",
  "time stamp for start of trial",
  "time stamp for end of trial",
  "time stamp when first TTL is sent on current trial (should be close to trialStart)",
  "formula is numPulses =  mod(max(0, treeNode.trialCount-1), self.maxPulses)+1;",
  "time stamp when last TTL pulse is sent on current trial",
  "in Report task: RT = choiceTime - sound1Off; In prediction task: RT = choiceTime - fixationOn",
  "1 for choosing Right, 0 for choosing Left",
  "1=correct, 0=wrong. NOTE: report task trials end with response (correctness is retrograde), prediction task starts with response (correctness is anterograde).",
  "where sound/tone occurred: 180 = Left, 0 = Right",
  "where source was (coding like direction)",
  "whether it is a catch trial (1) or not (0)"
  )
```

```{r}
print(data.table(columnName, description))
