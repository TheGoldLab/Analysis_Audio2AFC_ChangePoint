# Audio_2AFC_Analysis
Simulations and analysis for our auditory change-point task
# Development Workflow
- All contributors pull/push from `dev`, and work on individual feature branches. 
- Commits must be frequent
- Only tested code should be merged to `dev`.
- Only stable code should be merged to `master`.
- All functions and classes should be commented with [docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring#Python).
- I'll try to generate automatic documentation with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html).
